# MdiCompletion

**_The source code of this plugin is based on other repository's that I found on the internet!_** 

I created this for myself to find the icons faster while developing.


A plugin for Auto Completion for Material Design Icons (Version: 5.0.45) while typing.
Just start typing ":mdi" and the list with all the mdi icons will show. This plugin has only been tested on PhpStorm.
While you're hit `Tab` it will replace the select item with:
```html 
<i class="mdi mdi-account"></i>
```
